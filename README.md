# Network Analysis with Wireshark
## Objective

The goal of this project was to utilize Wireshark for in-depth network traffic analysis and to develop a strong understanding of network protocols, traffic patterns, and security vulnerabilities. The primary objective was to capture, analyze, and interpret network traffic to identify potential security threats and abnormal behavior within the network.
## Skills Learned

-    Mastery of Wireshark for capturing and analyzing network traffic.
-    Proficiency in identifying and interpreting various network protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, etc.).
-    Ability to detect and recognize suspicious network activity and potential security incidents.
-    Enhanced understanding of network architecture and the flow of data across a network.
-    Development of analytical thinking and problem-solving skills in the context of network security.

## Tools Used

-    Wireshark: For capturing and analyzing network traffic in real-time.
-    Packet Tracer: To simulate and visualize network environments.
-    Network Protocols: Understanding and application of various protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, and DNS.
-    Security Tools: Utilized complementary tools for deeper analysis, such as Snort or Suricata for intrusion detection.

## Steps

-    Network Traffic Capture: Initiated network traffic capture using Wireshark, ensuring all relevant interfaces were monitored.

-    Ref 1: Wireshark capturing live network traffic.

-    Protocol Analysis: Analyzed captured packets to understand the structure and function of various protocols. Focused on identifying patterns that could indicate normal or abnormal behavior.

-    Ref 2: Detailed view of TCP stream analysis in Wireshark.

-    Threat Detection: Applied filters and used Wireshark's built-in tools to detect potential security threats, such as unauthorized access attempts or data exfiltration.

-    Ref 3: Identifying suspicious traffic using Wireshark's filtering capabilities.

-    Report Generation: Compiled the analysis into a comprehensive report, highlighting key findings and suggesting mitigation strategies for detected vulnerabilities.

-    Ref 4: Example of an analysis report generated from Wireshark findings.
